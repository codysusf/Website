        Hello! I am Cody, I'm enrolling in the AIBA program. I've been in the building automation controls field for the past 8 years. 
        While developing this webpage, I learned a lot about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It was a fun and tedious process.</p><br>
      
      <p>JavaScript is being used for adding movies to the favorite movies ranking list. CSS is used throughout the website to make everything look professional and streamlined. 
        Chart.js was used for the pie chart, and additional JavaScript code was used to pull the data from the movie rating list </p><br>

        <p>Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/codysusf">GitHub</a> profile! Thanks for stopping by! </p>
